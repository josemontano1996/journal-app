# Journal App

Hello, welcome to the Journal App! This application is built entirely with React, utilizing Redux state management with Redux Toolkit.

## Features

- User Registration: Create an account using either email or Google account.
- Journal Entries: Log in to create new journal entries.
- Photo Upload: Upload photos to enhance your journal entries.

## Technologies Used

- React: The main framework used for building the app.
- Redux with Redux Toolkit: Employed for efficient state management.
- Firebase: Utilized for authentication and database storage of journal entries and image URLs.
- Cloudinary API: Integrated for image upload functionality.

## Cloudinary Image Deletion

Please note that image deletion using the Cloudinary API is not included in this project. The primary focus of this front-end project is to practice and learn Redux and CRUD operations. Implementing image deletion from the front-end can introduce security risks.

We recommend handling image deletion and other sensitive operations on the server-side to ensure better security, data consistency, and scalability.

Feel free to explore the app and enjoy the journaling experience!
